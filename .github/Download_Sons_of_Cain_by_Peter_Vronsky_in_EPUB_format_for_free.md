In Sons of Cain, Peter Vronsky argues that serial killing is not a modern phenomenon, but a result of a long evolutionary process that shaped the human predator. He traces the origins of serial murder to the prehistoric era, when humans had to compete with other predators for survival and resources. He then examines how serial killing evolved in different cultures and civilizations, from ancient Rome and China to medieval Europe and colonial America. He also analyzes how the Industrial Revolution, urbanization, and mass media influenced the emergence of new types of serial killers in the 19th and 20th centuries.
 
Vronsky also provides a comprehensive overview of the psychology and criminology of serial killers, based on his extensive research and interviews with experts and offenders. He explains how serial killers are classified into different categories, such as organized or disorganized, visionary or mission-oriented, hedonistic or power/control-oriented. He also explores the factors that contribute to the development of serial killers, such as genetics, brain damage, childhood trauma, personality disorders, and social conditions. He also discusses the challenges and methods of profiling, investigating, and catching serial killers, as well as the ethical and legal issues involved in dealing with them.
  
One of the most intriguing aspects of Sons of Cain is the author's personal connection to the topic. Peter Vronsky is not only a historian and journalist, but also a survivor of an encounter with a serial killer. In 1979, he met Richard Cottingham, a.k.a. the Torso Killer, in a New York hotel lobby and narrowly escaped his clutches. This experience sparked his interest in serial murder and led him to pursue a career in researching and writing about it. He also shares his insights and opinions on some of the most notorious serial killers he has studied or interviewed, such as Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrei Chikatilo, and others.
 
Sons of Cain is a captivating and comprehensive book that will appeal to anyone who wants to learn more about the history and psychology of serial killers. It is not for the faint of heart, as it contains graphic descriptions and images of some of the most horrific crimes ever committed. However, it is also a well-researched and well-written book that offers a balanced and nuanced perspective on a complex and controversial subject. It is a book that will make you think, question, and wonder about the nature of human evil and the origins of serial murder.
